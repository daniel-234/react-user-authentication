# React User Authentication

This simple application is a side project to create a user authentication application with React. 
We will rebuild [a project](https://github.com/chenkie/react-user-authentication) developed by Ryan Chenkie for a [course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/secure-auth-jwt/) on JWT on Frontend Masters. 
This frontend application will rely on an API built by following that same course, which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/daniel-234/user-authentication-api). 

Although it would have been easier to build this application by using `create-react-app`, I chose to build it from the ground up, starting from the simplest React application you'll ever build. 
In its first version (check the commit after the initial one) it uses two script tags to load the React and the ReactDOM libraries (their development versions) from a CDN. 
To build this project I will follow the [wonderful course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/) taught by Brian Holt at Frontend Masters as a complete introduction to React and its ecosystem. You can find his course notes [here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v4/).
