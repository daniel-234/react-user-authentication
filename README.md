# React User Authentication

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

This simple application is a side project to create a user authentication application with React. 
We will rebuild [a project](https://github.com/chenkie/react-user-authentication) developed by Ryan Chenkie for a [course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/secure-auth-jwt/) on JWT on Frontend Masters. 
This frontend application will rely on an API built by following that same course, which can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/daniel-234/user-authentication-api). 

Although it would have been easier to build this application by using `create-react-app`, I chose to build it from the ground up, starting from the simplest React application you'll ever build. 
In its first version (check the commit after the initial one) it uses two script tags to load the React and the ReactDOM libraries (their development versions) from a CDN. 
To build this project I will follow the [wonderful course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v4/) taught by Brian Holt at Frontend Masters as a complete introduction to React and its ecosystem. You can find his course notes [here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-react-v4/).

## Getting Started

To install this application you can (fork and) download it and then open the file `index.html` from your browser window. 
There's no other things to do at this point, as this app started as simple as possible, following the above philosophy.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
